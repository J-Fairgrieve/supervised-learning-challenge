# Supervised Learning Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (April 2022)

 The aim of this project was to create a series of machine learning models in order to predict the likelihood of a loan becoming high risk. Two models were used for this example:

  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier

  After the preliminary models were created, the data was scaled & the models ran once more.
